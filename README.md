# Cafe-Submission-Directory-Web-App

Tech Stack: Python, Flask, WTForms, Bootstrap 5, Jinja2, HTML/CSS

Built a user-friendly Flask web app for submitting and browsing cafes based on Wi-Fi quality, coffee rating, and power outlet availability.

Key Features:

Landing Page: Engaging homepage built with Bootstrap (jumbotron) that directs users to explore the database.

Modular Templating: Utilized Jinja2 inheritance (base.html, index.html, add.html, cafes.html) for clean and maintainable UI.

Interactive Form: Bootstrap-integrated WTForms for structured data input with validation.

Data Storage: Collected and retrieved cafe data using a CSV file, dynamically displayed in a table.

Routing: Multi-page navigation — home, add new cafe, and browse entries.

Outcome: Demonstrated full-stack development with user input handling, templated rendering, and front-end styling — all built from scratch with no database dependency.
